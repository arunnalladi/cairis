Configurable Types and Values
=============================


Asset Values
------------

You can assign descriptions for None, Low, Medium, and High asset values by selecting the Options / Asset Value value menu, and clicking on the Value to be updated.


Asset Types
------------

By default, CAIRIS databases are pre-defined with Information, Systems, Software, Hardware, and People asset types.

You can add a new asset type by selecting the Options / Asset Types menu and clicking on the Add button.  You should then enter an asset type name and description, before clicking the Create button.

Existing asset type name and descriptions can be modified by clicking on an asset type to be updated, making the required changes, and clicking on Update.

A selected asset type can be deleted by clicking on its delete button.  Although possible, we do not recommend deleting the standard asset types that come with CAIRIS.

If you are modelling a System of Systems, you may also benefit from using the asset type of *Systems - General*, used to reperesent organisations, groups, or social systems, and asset type *System of Systems* representing the combination of Independent Systems (collaborating to achieve a new combined purpose and goal).

Vulnerability and Threat Types
------------------------------

By default, CAIRIS models are pre-configured with vulnerability and threat types in the `ICS Protection Profile <https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#ics-protection-profile>`_.  These can be updated or overwritten, e.g. using one of the other threat and vulnerability type XML models.

Other Types
-----------

You can add a selection of types associated with risk and architectural models from the appropriate Options sub-menu by clicking on the Add button.  You should then enter a name, score, description, and -- where appropriate -- score and rationale before clicking on the Create button.

Existing values can be modified by clicking on the to be updated, making the required changes, and clicking the Update button.

A selected type can be deleted by clicking on its delete button.
